## Diff viewer in Azure DevOps
The diff viewer in pull requests can be very confusing in Azure DevOps because it does not show the actual diff, but rather a diff from BASE.

> In order to view the ACTUAL diff, go to the PR and click the three dots in the top-right corner and choose "View merge commit".
